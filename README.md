# Contrastive-Learning-in-Gastric-Cancer-Detection

This repository implements a contrastive learning approach for gastric cancer detection using deep learning. The project is a machine learning application that applies contrastive learning techniques, specifically utilising ResNet50 architecture, to improve the detection and classification of gastric cancer from medical imaging data. The repository contains Jupyter notebooks for experimentation, Python implementation files, and required dependencies documentation.

## Main Functions
Implementation of contrastive learning methodology for medical image analysis
Gastric cancer detection and classification system
ResNet50 neural network architecture utilization
Jupyter notebook-based experimental workflow
Python-based implementation

## Technology Stack
Python (primary programming language)
Jupyter Notebook (for interactive development and analysis)
ResNet50 (deep learning architecture)
Deep learning framework 
Standard ML libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn as indicated by requirements.txt)
